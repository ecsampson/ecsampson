<summary><h3>üó∫Ô∏è Ethan's Coding Journey</h3></summary>
    I got an interest in coding through video games and wanting to learn how to make my very own. My parents then bought me a Python Minecraft coding book in middle school and I started there. I didn't start coding in classes until my senior year in high school when I took AP Computer Science. I graduated from high school in 2020 during Covid and during that summer I started attending Michigan Technological University pursuing a computer science degree. During my time in college, I was able to work on several projects that were sponsored such as Houghton County Historical Society (HCHS) and Sound and Lights Service (SLS). During projects such as those and also my Underwater Image Enhancement AI Classification project, I really began to develop and interest in data and how I can analyze data to enhance customer experience's and how data interacts with the world. I have just graduated from Michigan Tech in August 2024, since then I have been pursuing my knowledge in data, while working on projects like developing websites in order to gain real world experience as I pursue a job in the technical side of the world.
